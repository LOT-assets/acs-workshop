[#kubernetes]
== Setup OpenShift Cluster

:profile: acs

To run OpenShift4, you need to have one provisioned using https://try.openshift.com[try.openshift.com] or can use any existing OpenShift4 cluster.	
Once you have your cluster, you can download the latest OpenShift client(oc) from https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/[here] and add to your path.	

You can check the OpenShift version using:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc version	
----

The output should show oc version >=4.7:	

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
Client Version: 4.7.0-202102130115.p0-c66c03f	
Kubernetes Version: {kubernetes-version}	
----

== Login to OpenShift Cluster

Using the information provided by the instructor, connect to the OpenShift console.

image::prereqs/labinformation.png[Lab Information, 800]

First, in the browser, connect to OpenShift Console *1.* using the credentials provided in *2.* and verify the access to the cluster

Also, verify the connection via CLI using this command on the terminal or command line:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc login <OpenShift-API-URL> --username=<myuser> --password=<mypass>
----

Using OpenShift-API-URL *3.*, myuser/mypass *2.*

image::prereqs/loginsuccess.png[Login Successfull, 800]

And then you are ready for review the ACM installation.

== Review the health of the services

Becuase this environment is prepared with a special aprovision method, ocasionally, don't all service start up correctly. One of these cases detected is ACS scanner database.

If you detect that information of the images is nos correct or incomplete in any lab, please follow the next steps:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
oc get pods -n stackrox
----

If the output shows that scanner-db is *Init:0/1*

image::prereqs/scanner-pods.png[Pods with errors, 800]

The container-init isn't sincronized. Resolve this using the following command.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
oc delete pod -l app=scanner-db -n stackrox
----

This procedure takes a few seconds. When this is done, please check that all pods are *running*

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
oc get pods -n stackrox
----
